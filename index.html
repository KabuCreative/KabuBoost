            <p>Every day there's a new "must-have" tool or a headline telling you that everything is changing. It's overwhelming, and frankly, a lot of it is noise.</p>
            <p>Whether you are a growing local company or a larger, multi-site operation, the challenges are the same: You know your business could be more efficient. But you're stuck in the day-to-day operations—managing disparate tools and manual workflows—leaving you with little time to actually implement the technology that would give you your time back.</p>

            <p>Most consultants try to sell you a shiny new AI tool and walk away. But if you layer technology over a broken process, you just get a more complex version of the same problem.</p>
            <p>At Kabu Boost, we believe in Process Re-engineering. We don't just "add AI", instead we re-architect how your work flows so that technology delivers the results you're looking for.  This means:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Business Process Mapping</strong><br/>We work with you and your team to map out how things actually get done. We identify the manual "leakage" where time and effort are being wasted.</li>
              <li><strong>Connecting Your Systems</strong><br/> Most businesses have tools that don't talk to each other. We build digital bridges so your data flows seamlessly across your business.</li>
              <li><strong>Customised Automation</strong><br/>Where appropriate, we build bespoke software and AI automations to connect systems and drive efficiencies.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Kabu Boost is the next evolution of <a href="https://kabucreative.com">Kabu Creative</a>, led by the partnership of Olivier and Nicole Harris. Together, we offer 30 years of industry experience, bringing the same technical rigor used by global corporations to our consulting client base.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>We apply our user experience toolkit to your business processes</strong><br/>
                We treat your internal workflows with the same rigor we use to design world-class software. By mapping your processes, interviewing your staff, and identifying specific opportunities, we design solutions that solve real-world problems rather than just adding "tech for tech's sake".
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>We've built automation at the largest scale</strong><br/>
                Our technical lead, Olivier, led the engineering for task automation software used by over 80,000 organisations worldwide. He brings the same enterprise-grade architectural rigor to your systems.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Psychology-led systems that people actually use</strong><br/>
                With our background in user experience and psychology, we know that the best technology fails if it's too complex. We design systems that are psychologically intuitive, ensuring your team actually adopts the new tools and feels empowered by them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Operational Excellence</strong><br/>
                We don't just "install a tool" and walk away. Instead, we help you formalise your workflows, document your best practices, and coach your team—ensuring your business (no matter its size) runs with the efficiency of a top-tier tech firm.
